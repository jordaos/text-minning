2	-2	Use 'debounce' as proper name for ThrottleWithTimeout which unfortunately is the poorly named Rx Throttle operator.  http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation  Debounce: Think of it as "grouping multiple events in one". Imagine that you go home, enter in the elevator, doors are closing... and suddenly your neighbor appears in the hall and tries to jump on the elevator. Be polite! and open the doors for him: you are debouncing the elevator departure. Consider that the same situation can happen again with a third person, and so on... probably delaying the departure several minutes.  Throttle: Think of it as a valve, it regulates the flow of the executions. We can determine the maximum number of times a function can be called in certain time. So in the elevator analogy.. you are polite enough to let people in for 10 secs, but once that delay passes, you must go!  http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ http://www.illyriad.co.uk/blog/index.php/2011/09/javascript-dont-spam-your-server-debounce-and-throttle/	Use 'debounce 'as proper name for ThrottleWithTimeout which unfortunately[-2]is the poorly[-2]named Rx Throttle operator .[sentence: 1,-2] http ://drupalmotion .[sentence: 1,-1] com /article /debounce -and -throttle -visual -explanation Debounce :Think of it as 'grouping multiple events in one '.[sentence: 1,-1] Imagine that you go home ,enter in the elevator ,doors are closing ...[sentence: 1,-1] and suddenly your neighbor appears in the hall and tries to jump on the elevator .[sentence: 1,-1] Be polite ![+0.6 punctuation mood emphasis][sentence: 2,-1] and open the doors for him :you are debouncing the elevator departure .[sentence: 1,-1] Consider that the same situation can happen again with a third person ,and so on ...[sentence: 1,-1] probably delaying the departure several minutes .[sentence: 1,-1] Throttle :Think of it as a valve ,it regulates the flow of the executions .[sentence: 1,-1] We can determine the maximum number of times a function can be called in certain time .[sentence: 1,-1] So in the elevator analogy ..[sentence: 1,-1] you are polite enough to let people in for 10 secs ,but once that delay[-2]passes ,you must go ![+0.6 punctuation mood emphasis][sentence: 2,-2] http ://unscriptable .[sentence: 1,-1] com /2009 /03 /20 /debouncing -javascript -methods /http ://www .[sentence: 1,-1] illyriad .[sentence: 1,-1] co .[sentence: 1,-1] uk /blog /index .[sentence: 1,-1] php /2011 /09 /javascript -dont -spam[-2][=0 negation]-your -server -debounce -and -throttle /[sentence: 1,-1] [result: max + and - of any sentence]
