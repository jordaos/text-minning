Consolidating ExecutorScheduler and ScheduledExecutorScheduler  ScheduledExecutorScheduler is just an extension of ExecutorScheduler so keeping them together for less surface area on the API.
Formatting to match codebase
Keeping ScheduledObserver out of public API  For now keeping ScheduledObserver an implementation detail until it's clear we want it part of the long-term public API.

Merge pull request #224 from benjchristensen/execution-hooks  RxJavaObservableExecutionHook
RxJavaObservableExecutionHook  Allow a plugin to intercept invocations of an Observable via its subscribe method.  Use cases:  - extra logging or metrics for start, return and error events when subscribing  - decorate (or replace) an 'onSubscribe' function with additional behavior  - decorate an Exception  - decorate a Subscription  This is modeled after Hystrix Plugins: http://netflix.github.com/Hystrix/javadoc/index.html?com/netflix/hystrix/strategy/executionhook/HystrixCommandExecutionHook.html  Javadocs will be at http://netflix.github.com/RxJava/javadoc/
added threadPoolForComputation and threadPoolForIO schedulers
Removed SleepingAction from Abstract scheduler. ExecutorScheduler throws exception for the delayed action.

Merge pull request #201 from benjchristensen/issue-200-merge-synchronization  Synchronize Observer on OperationMerge
Trying to fix non-deterministic test  - not sure of a way other than putting Thread.sleep in here to give time after each CountDownLatch triggers for the process scheduler to execute the next line of each thread  See https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/201 for more information.
Merge pull request #221 from benjchristensen/issue-216-error-handling  Error Handling Improvements - User Provided Observers/Functions
Restrict identification of "internal" operators to only the rx.operators package  - based on discussion at https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/221 - don't wrap at AtomicObserver again - anything outside of rx.operators will be wrapped
Protect subscribe/forEach implementations against user provided function failures  Related to https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/216  The new forEach unit test went into a deadlock prior to this fix.

Merge pull request #215 from benjchristensen/pull-212-manual-merge  Manual Merge of Pull Request #212
Small reorganization of code for OperationTake and TrustedObservableTester  - removed rx.testing package (if that's going to exist that means it's bleeding into something that should live in /src/test and beyond what works well for inner class testing) - made TrustedObservableTester part of rx.operation package and an inner UnitTest class so it doesn't become part of the public API
Merge branch 'take-test' of git://github.com/johngmyers/RxJava into pull-212-take-merge
take(0) subscribes to its source
Fix violations of the Observer contract.

Merge pull request #203 from mairbek/all-operation  All Operation Implemented
Merge pull request #197 from thegeez/take-while  TakeWhile observables do not properly complete
An attempt at implementing the correct combineLatest semantics. The tests do pass again now (they had to be adapted too).
made 'next' more typesafe
updated a test and added another one, trying to get the expected behavior right
Fix for Observable.toList failing with multiple subscribers
Failing test case to show Observable.toList breaks with multiple observers due to sharing of the buffer list
Added groovy test
Updated Observable API
Implemented all operation
Synchronization of Merge operator (fixes)  - return AtomicSubscription not MergeSubscription which I was accidentally still returning - try/finally in unit test so threads are released even if assertion is thrown
Synchronize Observer on OperationMerge  fixes https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/200  This is necessary because by definition Merge is subscribing to multiple sequences in parallel and is supposed to serialize them into a single Observable.
Whitespace
Extracted ScheduledObserver as a separate class

ObserveOn/SubscribeOn unit tests

Added to Schedulers
Added ScheduledExecutorServiceScheduler
Call complete on take/takeWhile observables once the predicate is true.
Failing test case to show bug in takeWhile
Incoporate review suggestions.  Splits a compound unit test into to parts. Uses mockito instead of a bespoke test object. Removes unused import statements. Changes the order of the Finally action w.r.t. onComplete/onError.
Added nonstatic Observable.finally0
Missing import
Add finally0 to Observable.java .
New operation Finally (issue #43)

more thorough error handling in case Func1 implementation itself fails  - Func1.call may fail (null impl, bad impl, etc) - Func1.call may success but the implementation itself may throw an exception instead of properly catching and sending to onError
add try/catch in example to better demonstrate error handling  ��� despite no errors being possible of being thrown in this code
gracefully handle null subscription on trusted onSubscribe the same as non-trusted already does
