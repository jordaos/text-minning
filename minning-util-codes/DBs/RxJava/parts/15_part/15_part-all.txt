Merge pull request #1357 from benjchristensen/mergeWith-and-friends  MergeWith, ConcatWith, AmbWith
MergeWith, ConcatWith, AmbWith  Single-arity instance versions of merge, concat and amb. Since we can't use the `merge`/`concat`/`amb` names on both static and instance methods, these have the `With` suffix, which actually reads quite well.  ```java o.mergeWith(o2).subscribe(ts); o.concatWith(o2).subscribe(ts); o.ambWith(o2).subscribe(ts); ```  If we feel the need for more arities fine, but I wanted to start simple.  This originated from discussions with @headinthebox and over a year of wanting instance methods for `merge`.

Merge pull request #1350 from benjchristensen/perf-tests  Baseline Performance Tests
Baseline Performance Tests  Start of suite of general performance tests for comparing overall changes.
Allow use of the returned subscription to cancel periodic scheduling  The documentation for schedulePeriodically indicates that the returned subscription can be used to unsubscribe from the periodic action, or to unschedule it if it has not been scheduled yet. That was the case only before the first action took place, and it was then impossible to unsubscribe using the given subscription, although unsubscribing the worker did work.

Merge pull request #1324 from benjchristensen/trampoline-schedule-unsubscribe  TrampolineScheduler & Unsubscribe
TrampolineScheduler & Unsubscribe  Unsubscribing should prevent new additions to a Worker, but not prevent already scheduled work, and definitely not affect other Workers using the same thread (by modifying the ThreadLocal as it was doing).  See the unit test for details of how unsubscribing 1 Worker could prevent work from being done on a completely separate Worker.
Merge pull request #1311 from craigmingtaozhang/master  Tiny integration test change
Ensuring Runnables posted with delay to a Handler are removed when unsubscribed.  This patch ensures the delayed runnables posted to a Handler are properly removed when Subscription.unsubscribe() is called on the Observable.  The original code returns the subscription from schedule() but is not used by the callers who instead add the Worker itself as a subsciption.  Signed-off-by: David Marques <dpsmarques@gmail.com>

Modify OnSubscribeToObservableFuture to return early if unsubscribe without emitting anything
2 new tests for OnSubscribeToObservableFuture  1) Creating an Observable from an already-cancelled Future should emit nothing (equivalent to Observable.never())    (it currently emits onError(CancellationException) 2) Creating an Observable from a Future then unsubscribeing immediately before Future.get()    unblocks should be an Observable.never().  This test already passes.
