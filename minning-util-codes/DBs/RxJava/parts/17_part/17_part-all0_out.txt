2	-2	Operator Scan Backpressure Fix  Problem 1) The initial value was being emitted before subscription which caused issues with request/producer state, particularly if filter() was used to skip that initial value and then called request(1) before the real request had been sent. Problem 2) The initial value was not accounted for by the request so it was sending 1 more value than requested. It now modifies the request to account for it. Problem 3) Redo relied upon these nuances to work. I've fixed this by using a simpler implementation that just maintains state within a map function.

2	-2	Optimize single BlockingObservable operations.  This changeset optimizes all blocking operations that just return a single value. The previous code used an iterator all the time, adding significant GC pressure with iterators and a backing LBQ.  The following numbers are from the added JMH tests just as a general measurement. The most boost is gained from small results and less GC pressure.
