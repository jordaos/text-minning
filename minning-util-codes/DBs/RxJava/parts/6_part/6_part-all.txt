Handle OnSubscribeFuncs correctly in JRuby interop logic  OnSubscribeFunc#onSubscribe expects to return a Subscription. I am unable to successfully cast the return value of a RubyProc, even if that value _is_ an object that implements the Subscription interface, into a Subscription in Java-land (Java reports that ConcreteJavaProxy cannot be cast). Instead I allow JRuby to handle OnSubscribeFunc arguments through its default proxy logic, which works correctly.
JRuby performance test
JRuby wrapper specs
Implement JRuby function wrapping support  Whenever a RubyProc is passed into an Observable method, wrap it in a Java class that implements the correct RxJava interfaces. This avoids ambiguous method errors and costly proxy instantiations by JRuby's default method delegation logic.

Merge pull request #394 from benjchristensen/issue-388  Change Interval and Sample default Scheduler
Merge pull request #393 from benjchristensen/parallel-operator  Parallel Operator & ObserveOn/ScheduledObserver Fixes
Change Interval and Sample default Scheduler  Change to use built-in thread-pools rather than creating a new Executor on each invocation. The built-in ones are shared across all operators, have threads ready, are marked as daemon threads so don't prevent system shutdown, and are named for clarity when looking at thread dumps and debuggers.
Merge pull request #391 from brad-uk/master  remove scalatest packages from OSGI imports
Reorg fields
Making Observable.synchronize an instance method rather than static
Parallel Operator  This operator came out of discussions and work with @headinthebox to allow explicit and composable declaration of blocks of work that can be scheduled for parallel execution.  An Observable event stream will be sharded using groupBy using a value from Scheduler. degreeOfParallelism() (defaulting to number of CPU cores) and perform the defined work in parallel.  Instead of having various parallel operators like parallelMap, parallelFilter parallelScan etc this can work generically for any operators or sequence of operators.
Fix ObserveOn, NewThreadScheduler and ScheduledObserver bugs  @headinthebox and I were working on some code and found differences in behavior between Rx.Net and RxJava with observeOn. This commit should fix that.
