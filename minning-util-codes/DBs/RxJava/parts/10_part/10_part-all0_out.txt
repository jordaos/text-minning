2	-3	Improve Error Handling and Stacktraces  The stacktraces were a mess when onError failed or was not implemented and unsubscribe also failed. That is a far edge case and means code is broken and breaking the Rx contracts ��� but that���s just when we need clear stacktraces. The CompositeException and SafeObserver class now do a dance and wire together a causal chain to provide a stacktrace that can identity all the points of error. Also standardized and simplified the RxJavaPlugin.onErrorHandler while working in the vicinity.  This came about after I was asked to help debug a problem and couldn���t do it by looking at the thrown exception, I had to use a debugger and step through.
