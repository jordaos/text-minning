All arguments to subscribe are now validated correctly at the beginning of method invocation and IllegalArgumentException thrown if null arguments are injected.  According to Rx Guideline 6.5 a null argument is considered "a catastrophic error occurs that should bring down the whole program anyway" and thus we immediately throw. A null argument should be caught immediately in development and has nothing to do with subscribe invocation which is what guideline 6.5 is talking about (since a null Observer can't have onError called on it anyways).

2	-2	Rewrite concat operation to not block on subscribe  The concat operator previously blocked on calling subscribe until all the sequences had finished. In quite some cases this results in unwanted (and unexpected) behaviour, such as when prefixing an infinite Observable with a fixed one, for example when using startWith (which calls concat): someInputStream.startWith(123).subscribe(x -> print(x)); This statement will block indefinitely if the input stream is infinite. Also on finite sequences it seems silly to have to wait for them to finish.  In this new approach the incoming observables are put into a queue, instead of waiting for the whole sequence to finish. When the first observable completes, the next one is taken from the queue and subscribed to, and so on. The queue can be extended while processing the observables, and onCompleted is only called when both the source of observables has completed and all observables in the queue have been read.
