Merge pull request #1409 from dpsm/master  Avoiding OperatorObserveOn from calling subscriber.onNext(..) after unsu...
Avoiding OperatorObserveOn from calling subscriber.onNext(..) after unsubscribe().  The OperatorObserveOn operator uses a scheduler to cancel subscriptions as well as to deliver the objects passing through it's onNext(..) in the right context.  Calling unsubscribe will schedule the actual unsubscription while not making sure that the child subscriber will no longer receive calls to onNext(..) after unsubscribe() returns.  This fix makes sure that after unsubscribe() returns no more onNext(..) calls will be made on the child subscribers.  Signed-off-by: David Marques <dpsmarques@gmail.com>

Merge pull request #1388 from mattrjacobs/eliminate-circular-exception-creation  CompositeException stops mutating nested Exceptions

Removed unused import
CompositeException does not mutate nested exceptions by attaching stacks, but instead aggregates them at print-time.  Since nothing is being mutated, there's no chance of accidentally creating a cycle in the Exception chain.

TakeUntil & NotificationLite  A rewrite of TakeUntil that doesn't leak NotificationLite.COMPLETE outside of itself. It causes problems to leak the sentinels as other operators also using NotificationLite get confused.

IOSSchedulers for RoboVM

Introduced 'rxjava-scalaz' project.  This project provides some type class instances for Observable.  * Monoid: Observable obviously forms a monoid in terms of concatenation. * Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadPlus: Observable can be a Stream-like Monad and can be MonadPlus as well as Monoid. * Traverse, Foldable: Observable can be Stream-like traversable. __NOTE: The operations for the instance is blocking calls.__ * etc.  About Testing, property based tests are applied by Scalaz's ScalaCheck binding.  For QuickStart, please refer to rx.java.scala.scalaz.examples.RxScalazDemo.
