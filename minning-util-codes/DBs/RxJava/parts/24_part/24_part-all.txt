Avoid potential NPE when onError throws. (#4398)  t2 was only initialized if canceling threw an exception. In the happy path it would have never been initialized so when onError threw the call to suppress() would NPE.
2.x: Completable.test cancel TestSubscriber when wanted (#4395)
2.x: Single.test dispose TestSubscriber when wanted (#4394)
Remove explicit StackOverflow check as its a VirtualMachineError. (#4391)  Looks like [the linked comment][1] was misinterpreted (but not in a way that affected the implementation) as Scala considered StackOverflowError as non-fatal but RxJava always considered it fatal. As such, its explicit check was redundant.   [1]: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/748#issuecomment-32471495
Remove unused test methods from safe observer/subscriber. (#4387)
Move error consumer helper to internal API. (#4386)
Free upstream resources when default observer/subscriber is canceled. (#4385)
Remove reference counted Disposable public type. (#4388)  This is a very specific use case to provide as a first-party type which can always be added back later should there be sufficient demand.
Do not promise a new instance where we return a singleton. (#4384)
Remove double dash on RxThreadFactory thread names. (#4383)  Also optimize name creation to avoid StringBuilder having to expand its underlying char[].

Correct factory method name for converting an RS Publisher. (#4381)
Move single-use top-level type to nested class of its only use. (#4379)
Remove test scheduler factory. (#4380)  This method is misleading in that it's a factory next to a bunch of accessor methods to shared resources. The TestScheduler constructor is public and can be used directly.

Add 'WithUpstream' interfaces to connectable implementations. (#4333)
Fix compilation warnings
Extract 'WithUpstream' interfaces. (#4326)  This allows use with types that do not extend directly from their base stream types.
Skip static factories when converting between stream types. (#4324)  Also rename Publisher->Completable factory method and operator implementation to match other stream types.
No scheduler change happens for timeInterval() and timestamp(). (#4323)

Switch (almost) all chain operators to FlowableWithUpstream. (#4318)
Rename create to unsafeCreate, add "safe" create methods. (#4317)  This change is built around one goal: make the `create` methods actually usable by developers!  Currently the advice given to most developers using 1.x is avoid `create` unless you are absolutely 100% sure you understand backpressure and cancellation, and even then avoid it if possible. This is a trap that most new developers fall into. _The method is named "create", after all, so it must be how I create these things!_ I want to make that not only correct, but advisable (at least when the still-convenient "from" methods are not suitable, such as when wrapping callback-based APIs).  Because `Observable`, `Single`, and `Completable` are backpressure-free, this amounts to just suppressing downstream notifications when disposed. This doesn't seem too controversial.  The most controversial part is that I have renamed `Flowable.fromAsync` to `Flowable.create` thus making it the canonical way for users to create `Flowable`s directly. I'm much less opinionated on this change, but it felt wrong to have an `Flowable.unsafeCreate` with no associated `create` and `fromAsync` is the "safest" version we have.
