Merge pull request #2594 from benjchristensen/test-subscriber  Revert Behavior Change in TestSubscriber.awaitTerminalEvent
Revert Behavior Change in TestSubscriber.awaitTerminalEvent  Reverts change made at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/2332/files#diff-fbed6a16f49022fd2b10f45fd6dd015bR230  See discussion at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/2549#issuecomment-72783738  The Javadoc for this method clearly states that it will wait until completion or timeout. It does not say it will throw an exception on timeout, so we can not start throwing as that is a behavioral change.

Fixed potential request value overflow.
Factored out the backpressure management into an experimental class and reimplemented Buffer and Block strategies with it.
