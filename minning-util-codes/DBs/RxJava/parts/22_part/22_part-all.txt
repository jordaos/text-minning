Operator generate: create an observable that generates values by calling  a function and handling backpressure/resource cleanup automatically.  The logic is based on @stealthcode 's SyncSubscriber proposal from 1.x but using only the lambda-form.

Merge pull request #3265 from akarnokd/RxJavaPluginsPerfFix  RxJavaPlugins performance enabling fix & lockdown.
RxJavaPlugins performance enabling fix & lockdown.  By using null checks and direct returns we can avoid a dynamic dispatch on a volatile variable which always more expensive.  I've also added the `lockdown()` method to prevent any further changing of the plugin handlers. There is a `unlock` package-private method to allow testing the plugin in the locked state and then return to the unlocked state as other tests may want to install custom plugins.
Merge pull request #3264 from akarnokd/AsyncObserver2x  AsyncObserver
AsyncObserver  It is meant to be somewhat a replacement for 1.x rx.Subscriber, but it doesn't support Subscriber chaining.  I call it Observer because one only needs to implement onNext, onError and onComplete as with rx.Observer

Merge pull request #3262 from akarnokd/WindowBoundary2x  Operator window with boundary (exact, selector, exact + supplier).
Operator window with boundary (exact, selector, exact + supplier).  I'm not 100% certain about the state management: when to let the main source keep running and when to stop. I.e., the in the selector version, if the other completes, it means no new window will be opened but the active should keep receiving values until their closer fires. If all such closers have fired, the main can be stopped.
