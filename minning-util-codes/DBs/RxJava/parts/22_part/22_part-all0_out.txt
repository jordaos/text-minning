2	-2	RxJavaPlugins performance enabling fix & lockdown.  By using null checks and direct returns we can avoid a dynamic dispatch on a volatile variable which always more expensive.  I've also added the `lockdown()` method to prevent any further changing of the plugin handlers. There is a `unlock` package-private method to allow testing the plugin in the locked state and then return to the unlocked state as other tests may want to install custom plugins.
